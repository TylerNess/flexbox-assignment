    <p>Git is a collabrative tool that helps protect you and others from yourself and others. The first state a file can be in is modified which is the file with new changes that is not on git. The second state is staged which is similar to just being a box outside of storage. Comitted is the last stage and the file is placed in long term storage and can be accessed from the git. Ibelieve I am a 4 rating on the topic.</p>
